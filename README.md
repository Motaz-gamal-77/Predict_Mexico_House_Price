# Predict_Mexico_House_Price
## About Repository
In this repository I will use a dataset of 21,000 properties to determine if real estate prices are influenced more by property size or location. Then I build data visualizations, and examine the relationship between two variables using correlation. Finally I will build a Linear Regression model and Ridge Regression to predict apartment prices in Mexico. Additionally, I also create a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and they improve model performance by reducing overfitting.

This project was inspired by the lesson I learned in [WQU](https://www.wqu.edu/)
